# This class is useful to set up an existing Dropbox account in a state which
# is ready to pass the tests.
#
# For example, on the tests for the `delete` endpoint you may be deleting the
# file at `/delete/file.txt`, so we need to upload a file at that location or
# the test won't pass. That's exactly what {DropboxScaffoldBuilder#delete} is
# expected to do.
#
# Other endpoints' tests will have different requirements and this class is to
# provide an automated way to fulfill these. For each endpoint we need to test,
# you may have a method here that sets up everything that the tests for that
# endpoint needs.
#
# Note that, paradoxically, the methods here use the same methods we want to
# test. This shouldn't be a problem as the purpose of this is to allow us to
# regenerate the VCR cassettes, so if this automated mechanism fails you can
# always do the job manually and record the VCR cassette without using this.
#
# The Dropbox server may introduce minor changes over time so it's good to
# regenerate the cassettes every now and then, but we don't need to do it in
# every execution of the test suite.
